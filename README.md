# THEORY:
## What is Light Dependent Resistor?
An electronic component like LDR or light-dependent resistor is responsive to light. Once light rays drop on it, then immediately the resistance will be changed. The resistance values of an LDR may change over several orders of magnitude. The resistance value will be dropped when the light level increases.
The resistance values of LDR in darkness are several megaohms whereas in bright light it will be dropped to hundred ohms. So due to this change in resistance, these resistors are extremely used in different applications. The LDR sensitivity also changes through the incident light’s wavelength.
The designing of LDRs can be done by using semiconductor materials to allow their light-sensitive properties. The famous material used in this resistor is CdS (cadmium sulfide), even though the utilization of this material is currently restricted in European countries due to some environmental issues while using this material. Likewise, CdSe (cadmium selenide) is also restricted and additional materials that can be employed mainly include PbS (lead sulfide), InS ( indium antimonide).
Even though for these resistors, a semiconductor material is used, because they are simply passive devices and they do not have a PN-junction. This detaches them from other LDRs such as phototransistors & photodiodes.

## LDR Symbol
In electronic circuits, the LDR symbol is used that mainly depends on the resistor symbol; however, it illustrates the light rays in the arrows form. In this way, it follows the same principle which is used for phototransistor & photodiode circuit symbols wherever arrows are utilized to demonstrate the light dropping on these types of components. The LDR circuit symbols are shown below.

## Construction of an LDR
The construction of an LDR includes a light-sensitive material that is placed on an insulating substrate like ceramic. The material is placed in a zigzag shape in order to get the required power rating and resistance. The area of zigzag separates the metal-placed areas into two regions.

Where the Ohmic contacts are made either on the sides of the area. The resistances of the contacts must be as less as possible to make sure that the resistance, mainly varies due to the light effect only. The use of lead & cadmium materials is avoided as they are injurious to the environment.
## Working Principle of Light Dependent Resistor
The working principle of an LDR is photoconductivity, which is nothing but an optical phenomenon. When the light is absorbed by the material then the conductivity of the material enhances. When the light falls on the LDR, then the electrons in the valence band of the material are eager to the conduction band. But, the photons in the incident light must have energy superior to the bandgap of the material to make the electrons jump from one band to another band (valance to conduction).
Hence, when light having ample energy, more electrons are excited to the conduction band which grades in a large number of charge carriers. When the effect of this process and the flow of the current starts flowing more, the resistance of the device decreases.
## Characteristics of LDR
The light-dependent resistor is very responsive to light. When the light is stronger, then the resistance is lower which means, when the light intensity increases then the value of resistance for the LDR will be decreased drastically to below 1K.

When the light drops on LDR, the resistance will be decreased and when the resistor is placed in the dark then the resistance will be increased which is called dark resistance. If any device absorbs light then its resistance will be reduced radically. If a stable voltage is given to it, the light intensity will be increased & the flow of current starts increasing. So, the following diagram represents the characteristics between resistance & illumination for a specific LDR.

LDRs are not linear devices and their sensitivity changes through the light’s wavelength which drops on them. Some kinds of photocells are not at all sensitive to a specific range of wavelengths because it depends on the used material.

Once light rays fall on a photocell, the resistance will be changed in 8 ms to 12, while it uses few more seconds to rise the resistance back again to its early value once the light is removed. So this is known as a recovery rate of resistance. In audio compressors, this property is applicable.
## Applications of LDR
Light-dependent resistors are simple and low-cost devices. These devices are used where there is a need to sense the presence and absence of light is necessary. These resistors are used as light sensors and the applications of LDR mainly include alarm clocks, street lights, light intensity meters, burglar alarm circuits. For a better understanding of this concept, here we have explained one project namely; power conserving of intensity controlled street lights using LDR.
## What is IoT?

Internet of Things (IoT) describes an emerging trend where a large number of embedded devices (things) are connected to the Internet. These connected devices communicate with people and other things and often provide sensor data to cloud storage and cloud computing resources where the data is processed and analyzed to gain important insights. Cheap cloud computing power and increased device connectivity is enabling this trend.IoT solutions are built for many vertical applications such as environmental monitoring and control, health monitoring, vehicle fleet monitoring, industrial monitoring and control, and home automation
 
## Sending Data to Cloud with ESP32 and ThingSpeak
ThingSpeak is an Internet of Things (IoT) analytics platform that allows users to collect, analyze, and visualize data from sensors or devices connected to the Internet. It is a cloud-based platform that provides APIs for storing and retrieving data, as well as tools for data analysis and visualization.The Internet of Things ( or IoT) is a network of interconnected computing devices such as digital machines, automobiles with built-in sensors, or humans with unique identifiers and the ability to communicate data over a network without human intervention.Hello readers, I hope you all are doing great. In this tutorial, we will learn how to send sensor readings from ESP32 to the ThingSpeak cloud. Here we will use the ESP32’s internal sensor like hall-effect sensor and temperature sensor to observe the data and then will share that data cloud.
